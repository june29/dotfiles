That means not only does this package give you suggestions for base constructs / types, but it will also suggest your variables, functions, contracts, etc. What's more is that it will only give you suggestions when they allowed syntax-wise. (This is based on context level so you still could get some suggestions out of place, but nothing too radical should be happening.)\n\n### Autocomplete Example\n![autocomplete-solidity](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2007045/15446666/daf7144c-1ee4-11e6-93fa-e2902ef954b9.gif)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/austp/autocomplete-solidity/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/austp/autocomplete-solidity#readme","_id":"autocomplete-solidity@0.3.4","_shasum":"2f54b516c3e63c8b78091a1e2d75ed9d919cef4c","_resolved":"file:../d-1171030-1766-1k146hh.s4yv31sjor/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1171030-1766-1k146hh.s4yv31sjor/package.tgz"}
